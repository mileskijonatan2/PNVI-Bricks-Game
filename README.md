### Project info
This project is made in PyGame. The game is the modification of the Breakout Game, but this time there are four sliding bars, 2 vertically and 2 horizontally. Among the bricks there are bricks which can cause the player to lose live, bricks that can cause the the score to go down, or can speed up the ball speed. The player should move the paddles (horizontal and vertical bars) by AWSD or arrow keys. The player can hit the space button when they want to generate new random position of the ball. This is usually done to prevent the ball from hitting the red (deadly) bricks. Currently there are three levels of this games. They are red from input file in which the percentage of each bricks type is specified and the number of bricks in the middle row and column (only one number, columns and rows must have same number of bricks).
